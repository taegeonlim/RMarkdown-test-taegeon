## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

##my assignment.

**my assignment is using R for to network analysis in maritime ship liners which carries container so i am going to collect data from journals like unstructered data **

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

m<- matrix(1:20, nrow = 4, ncol= 5)
m
m2<- matrix(1:4, nrow = 2, ncol= 2)
m2
dimnames(m2) <-list(c("a","b"), c("c","d"))
m2
